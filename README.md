pollen ðŸŒ»
============

A cozy, lightweight application to run a simple CLI chat server capable of hosting multiple channels, handle private messages and more!

In this repository there's both a client application to connect to pollen servers and the server application, all written in Erlang/OTP25.

Features included:
- A global channel for everyone to meet.
- Public/private chat channels.
- Invite-only conversation.
- Private messaging between users.
- Clean CLI interface with colors.
- Fully concurrent and lightweight by design.

How to Run (in Docker)
-------

You will have to spin up the server container, this will automatically create a new release with the rebar3 release command.

    $ docker compose up -d

Your pollen server is live and ready to accept connections at

    $ 0.0.0.0:4000

Testing (in Docker)
-------

To test the application in an isolated environment, you can access the server container's shell. It's recommended to open multiple terminal sessions to simulate interactions between different clients.

    $ docker exec -it pollen-server /bin/bash

Once inside, compile the client module and start an Erlang shell to connect:

    $ erlc pollen_client.erl
    $ erl -noshell -sname alice -eval "p:main([\"localhost\",\"4000\",\"Alice\"])"

For convenience, youâ€™ll find three pre-configured clients inside the **/clients/** directory. After compilation, use them to test the various features of the server.

Hosting
-------

By default your pollen server will be hosted on port **4000** but you can configure this and other options under **/includes/env.hrl**. You will also have to
modify the port inside the docker-compose.yaml and rebuild the application with **rebar3 release**

Your clients will be able to:

- Use /join to enter or create a channel
- Use /channel to create a public channel
- Many more commands available with /help
