pollen ðŸŒ»
============

A cozy, lightweight application to run a simple CLI chat server capable of hosting multiple channels, handle private messages and more!

In this repository there's both a client application to connect to pollen servers and the server application, all written in Erlang/OTP25.

Features included:
- A global channel for everyone to meet.
- Public/private chat channels.
- Invite-only conversation.
- Private messaging between users.
- Clean CLI interface with colors.
- Fully concurrent and lightweight by design.

How to Run (in Docker)
-------

You will have to spin up the server container, this will automatically create a new release with the rebar3 release command.

    $ docker compose up -d

Your pollen server is now live and ready to accept connections at

    $ 0.0.0.0:4000

Usage (in Docker)
-------

To test the application in an isolated environment, you can access the server container's shell. It's recommended to open multiple terminal sessions to simulate interactions between different clients.

    $ docker exec -it pollen-server /bin/bash

Once inside, compile the client module and start an Erlang shell to connect:

    $ erlc pollen_client.erl
    $ erl -noshell -sname alice -eval "p:main([\"localhost\",\"4000\",\"Alice\"])"

For convenience, youâ€™ll find three pre-configured clients inside the **/clients/** directory. After compilation, use them to test the various features of the server.

You will find a full list of available commands with /join

ðŸš€ MIT Server Team Challenge Instructions
-------

Instructions on how to run the challenge.

### Erlang project setup 

First of all let's boot the server with 

    $ docker compose up -d

There's no need to build anything manually, the release comes with the container through rebar3 release, after that we compile the client with

    $ erlc pollen_client.erl

And then we're ready to go.

To test the API effectively, it's recommended to open multiple terminals to simulate different TCP/IP clients communicating simultaneously.

### Accept multiple TCP/IP client connections at the same time

To test concurrent connections, use the preconfigured clients Alice and Bob:

    $ ./clients/alice   # in terminal 1
    $ ./clients/bob     # in terminal 2

### Handle rooms

The following commands test the various chat room features. Note: after typing a command, you'll be prompted for any necessary arguments.

    $ > /channel
    $ > /close
    $ > /list
    $ > /join
    $ > /leave
    $ > <message>

### Send private messages

To send a private message to another user:

    $ > /pmessage

### Handle private rooms

To test and handle a private room, we can use the following commands:

    $ > /pchannel
    $ > /invite

We can verify that some rooms are hidden from others by running the /list command from a different terminal.

Hosting
-------

By default your pollen server will be hosted on port **4000** but you can configure this and other options under **/includes/env.hrl**. Make sure to change the port inside the docker-compose.yaml aswell

Your clients will be able to:

- Use /join to enter or create a channel
- Use /channel to create a public channel
- Many more commands available with /help
